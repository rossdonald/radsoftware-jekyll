<h2>Practical Solutions</h2>
<p>
  My focus is on delivering practical solutions that provide value to your
  business.
</p>
<h2>Computer Systems for Human Beings</h2>
<p>
  Computer system must be simple and easy to use. The easier a program is to use
  the more useful it is.
</p>
<h2>Long Term Outlook</h2>
<p>
  Software Solution need to work now and in the future. Maintenance must not be
  overlooked in the rush to get things done. I believe good design and planning
  leads to a stable system that can be modified easily when business
  requirements change.
</p>
<h2>Visible Results</h2>
<p>
  Working closely with the client, often on-site produces visible results and
  gets a system up and running quickly.
