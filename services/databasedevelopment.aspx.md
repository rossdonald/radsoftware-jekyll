<h2>Databases - The Heart of Business Applications</h2>
<p>
  Most Business Applications store information in a Database. A well designed
  Database supports the processes of the Business and allows it to grow in the
  future.
</p>
<h2>SQL Server Database Design</h2>
<p>
  Medium to large clients choose Microsoft SQL Server to take advantage of its
  speed, reliability and transaction support. We ensure that the database is
  designed for performance and maintenance. SQL Server is also used for its
  comprehensive security system and excellent performance.
</p>
<h2>Performance Tuning and Optimisation</h2>
<p>
  It is important to keep your database software performing well. We analyse the
  database design to remove processing bottlenecks. The design of tables can be
  changed and indexes added to improve system performance.
</p>
<h2>
  Data Manipulation and Transformation
</h2>
<p>
  SQL Server Data Transformation Services (DTS) is a powerful import and export
  service that lets SQL Server extract, transform, and consolidate data from
  disparate sources into single or multiple destinations. DTS can import data
  into your application from a wide range of data sources.
</p>
<h2>
  Data Warehousing with SQL Server Analysis Services
</h2>
<p>
  SQL Server makes it an excellent choice as a Data Warehouse due to its robust
  nature and its integrated Analysis Server.
</p>
<p>
  Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services is a middle-tier server for online
  analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining. It organizes data from a data
  warehouse into OLAP cubes to provide rapid answers to complex analytical
  queries. Clients can then use familiar tools like Microsoft Excel to query the
  Data Warehouse and produce their own reports. The data stored by the OLAP
  cubes is pre-calculated so queries are extremely fast.
</p>
<h2>SQL Server Security and Configuration</h2>
<p>
  Installing and configuring SQL Server requires some planning and forethought.
  Our knowledge of SQL Server security configuration gives you a head start on
  setting up a new server or coming to grips with an existing installation.
