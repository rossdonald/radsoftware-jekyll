<p>
  Custom web application development using a database driven web site is a
  powerful way to serve dynamic content to your customers, business partners and
  employees. A website powered by a database such as Microsoft SQL Server lets
  users browse a product catalog, search online and produce customized reports.
</p>
<p>
  We specialize in web application development using Microsoft ASP.NET, the .NET
  Framework and SQL Server.
</p>
<h2>Distributing Information with a Database driven Website</h2>

<p>
  Web applications are an excellent method of providing information internally
  to employees, and externally to customers. Reports displayed as web pages can
  be viewed from any location that has access to the internet by setting up a
  web server that connects to your database. Access to the system can be
  controlled by a security system.
</p>
<h2>Improve Quality of Service to your Customers</h2>

<p>
  A database driven website can help to provide better service to your
  customers. Your customers can access information directly over the internet
  without having to wait on the phone to talk to a Customer Service Rep. The web
  application can query your company database to find out the status of orders
  or the wait time on jobs.
</p>
<h2>Collecting Information with a Web Application</h2>

<p>
  A web application provides an alternative to a manual process of collecting
  information. Instead of getting letters, faxes, phone calls and emails, your
  clients or users can connect to a web application using their web browser and
  enter the information directly. Allowing customers to enter information
  directly reduces the amount of time your employees spend gathering data from
  customers.
</p>
<h2>Work Anywhere Anytime</h2>

<p>
  A dynamic website using ASP.NET can enable remote access to databases and
  applications from the other side of the country or around the world.
</p>
<h2>Ease of Deployment and Maintenance</h2>

<p>
  All that is required to use a database driven website is a web browser, which
  has become standard desktop software. There are no setup files or installation
  CD&#39;s to send out to customers or staff to get a web application up and
  running. Simply enter the address of the website and it can be accessed
  immediately.
</p>
<p>
  Ease of deployment also provides advantages when the application is
  distributed and the users of the application are located remotely. Any
  development changes made to the web application are displayed immediately,
  again getting rid of the need for setup files and application updates on CD.

<h2>ASP.NET - Technical Information</h2>

<p>
  The Microsoft .NET Framework includes rich support for dynamic web pages with
  ASP.NET. ASP.NET Core is the next version of Microsoft&#39;s web Framework and
  includes a number of major enhancements.
</p>
<p>
  One of the big changes in ASP.NET is the move from a script based language
  (VBscript) to a set of fully compiled programming languages. With ASP.NET the
  code behind web pages is written using the same programming language that the
  .NET Framework uses (C#). When using ASP.NET the code behind the web page is
  compiled before being deployed to the Web server. This results in faster pages
  with fewer programming errors.
