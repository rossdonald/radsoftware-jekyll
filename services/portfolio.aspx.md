<h2>
  TheOnlinePrinter
</h2>
<p>
  Rad software was given the brief to create an online e-commerce store for
  TheOnlinePrinter. Customers select the product they are interested in and are
  taken to a page that calculates the price in real time. Orders are submitted
  directly into the database and a notification e-mail is sent to the site
  administrator.
</p>
<p>The website was built from scratch and features:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>A database of orders, products and associated pricing information</li>
  <li>Real-time price calculation of prices</li>
  <li>Calculation of shipping costs based on country and post code</li>
  <li>Integration with an online design service</li>
  <li>Invoices in PDF format</li>
  <li>Secure SSL transactions</li>
  <li>Content Management System (CMS) for information pages</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Site administrators can login to the secured section to view orders and update
  product information.
</p>
<p>Technologies: .NET, SQL Server Database</p>

<h2>RFID Library and Application</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.e-isg.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >E-Innovative Services Group</a
  >
  approached Rad Software with an interesting project. Their existing .NET Asset
  Management system required an upgrade to support RFID tags and readers. The
  tags would be used to locate assets within large offices and to ensure
  equipment has not been moved.
</p>
<p>
  Rad Software wrote a .NET library to communicate with the RFID reader hardware
  via TCP/IP and through a serial connection. Then the RFID library was
  incorporated into the Asset Manager application.
</p>
<p>
  Technologies: .NET, Windows Forms, RFID, TCP/IP, Serial port
